### Folder Structure

Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
soultrain/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- components/
|- constants/
|- ui/
|- utils/
|- main.dart
```

```
1- components - Contains the common widgets that are shared across multiple screens.

2- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files.

3- ui - This directory contains all the ui of your application. Each screen is located in a separate folder making it easy to combine group of files related to that particular screen. All the screen specific widgets will be placed in `components` directory

4- Contains the common file(s) and utilities used in a project

5- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```

### Constants

This directory contains all the application level constants. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
constants/
|- constants.dart
```

### UI

This directory contains all the ui of your application. Each screen is located in a separate folder making it easy to combine group of files related to that particular screen. All the screen specific widgets will be placed in `components` directory as shown in the example below:

   |- login_screen.dart
   |- components
      |- login_form.dart
      |- login_screen_top_image.dart

```dart

import 'package:soultrain/ui/welcome/welcome_screen.dart';
import 'package:soultrain/constants/constants.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'Flutter Auth',
      theme: ThemeData(
          primaryColor: Constants.kPrimaryColor,
          scaffoldBackgroundColor: Colors.white,
          elevatedButtonTheme: ElevatedButtonThemeData(
            style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
              elevation: 0,
              backgroundColor: Constants.kPrimaryColor,
              shape: const StadiumBorder(),
              maximumSize: const Size(double.infinity, 56),
              minimumSize: const Size(double.infinity, 56),
            ),
          ),
          inputDecorationTheme: const InputDecorationTheme(
            filled: true,
            fillColor: Constants.kPrimaryLightColor,
            iconColor: Constants.kPrimaryColor,
            prefixIconColor: Constants.kPrimaryColor,
            contentPadding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(
                horizontal: Constants.defaultPadding,
                vertical: Constants.defaultPadding),
            border: OutlineInputBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(30)),
              borderSide: BorderSide.none,
